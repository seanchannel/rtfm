# RTFM

This worked about 8 years ago but things have changed since then and this needs an update to stay dockerized, sorry, just keeping it here to work on later as a pet project.

The setup is dwww + document parsers for gnu info and various /usr/share/doc formants with fuzzy search from swish++ so you get a web UI searching *all* the documents installed. The only exception would be things that only provide help on the command line (e.g. with "-h" "--help" or "-?") and that would be neat to include.
